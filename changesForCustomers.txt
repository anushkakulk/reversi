Our code was already loosely coupled and we did not send our customers many concrete classes. We
did however forget to send one interface (the IPlayerMove interface) and so we remedied that fix. This
was necessary because our Strategy interface returns an IPlayerMove, which is what the ReversiPlayer
interface returns when the player's decision is queried. Hence we had to send that forgotten interface
as well. We properly sent all our interfaces and views with no changes, since all our classes were
all designed to work with interfaces and not implementations. We also received no notes from our customers
requesting any design changes for looser coupling or implementation detail questions, leading us to believe
our code was well designed and documented.
